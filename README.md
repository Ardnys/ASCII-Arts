# ASCII-Arts
Image to ASCII art with 6 or 7 languages with some *sprinkles* on top 

**Languages**
- ~~Python~~ 
- Java
- **C** (currently working on)
- Rust
- C#
- Julia
- Go (i don't know go but what if I learn it just to make this)

Most likely developed in this order. As of 7/7/2023 I am figuring out what I want in Python.
When it's finished I am planning to make a funny video as well. 

Didn't age well
